Bit about python:
    - Modular Programming
        This is what most people are familiar.
    - Object oriented Programming 
        This is somethign that is very useful and people might not be very familiar
    - Mixture of these two
        This I think gives the maximum benifit

    Talk a bit about using these efficiently as per needs.

Matplotlib styling
    - This is something I discovered recently and I think it is useful.
        - You can create style files and theme your plots according to needs
          without changing the python code. For example, you might want to 
          have same plot on a slide with larger font and on a paper with smaller
          font and smaller linewidth. 

Organizing Python Code
    - Creating python package (which can be imported in scripts or notebooks)
        - Relative imports
        - absolute imports

    - Using your own package as library

Creating Pip Installable Package:
    - Making portable standalone code
    - Upload your package in pypi repository
