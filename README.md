# Programming Tips
This is an informal talk I presented to my friends at the Physics Graduate Student Association(PGSA) at Drexel University on Winter 2020.

I talk about using different tools and techniques related to programming to increase the work effeciency. Although I talk briefly about using Cadabra as a tensor calculation tool, most of the content assumes the use of python as a programming tool. But I hope the tip carry over to any other programming language.

The slides do not contain a lot of info, I mostly gave demonstration to try to elucidate what I meant.
